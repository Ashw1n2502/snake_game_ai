# snake_game_ai

> This project was created utilising chatgpt ai prompts to create Python code for a snake game.
> Utilised chatgpt4 by iterating through many prompts to produce clean and functional code to enable a fully functioning snake game.

> Overview:
> A basic snake game has been created which includes a dynamic scoring system, snake size and colouring.
> The user starts the game and aims to gain points by controlling the snake to eat the food without touching the sides of the game.
